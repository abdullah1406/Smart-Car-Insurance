# Smart Car Insurance System

## Project Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a **Car Insurance Management System** built using Python in Jupyter Notebook. It is designed to simulate the key functions of an insurance platform, such as customer registration, premium estimation, and basic claim processing logic.

It serves as a beginner-level simulation for understanding how insurance systems work and how data can be managed and analyzed in such a domain.

## Features

* Customer information input (Name, Age, Vehicle details, etc.)
* Insurance premium calculation based on risk factors
* Simple claim request and approval simulation
* Console-based user interaction (input/output)
* Modular and easy to customize for further expansion

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x  
* Jupyter Notebook  
* Google Colab (optional)  
* Basic Data Structures (Lists, Dicts)  

## Project Status

**This project is complete and functional. Future improvements may include GUI integration or database support.**
